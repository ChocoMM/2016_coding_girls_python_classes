    """Our first class: just a simple demo

    A class is a namespace by itself. When seeing the class keyword,
    a class definition begins. And when the indentation ends, the class
    definition ends and a class object is created.
    So a new class is an object--similar to Ruby and you can create a
    class from metaclass just like you are about to create an object
    from a class. This sounds confusing? Just bear with me for a while.
